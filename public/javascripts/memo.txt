Thanks for the Answer! Do you know an example how I would pass a route? – Daniel Schmidt Apr 13 at 3:46

@DanielSchmidt Did you take a look at the transitionTo documentation? It shows several examples. You'd probably do router.transitionTo('/dashboard') – Michelle Tilley Apr 13 at 3:47

There is an issue with react.router discussing about this. github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/975 This is solved by updating React to 0.13.1 and React Router to 0.13.2 – almoraleslopez Apr 15 at 19:37

the links are broken because the api documentation was removed, for reference we can be found in github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/… – individuo7 Jul 31 at 14:36
